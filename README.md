This project started as a messy website that needed to be refactored. Perfect for me, since I am learning how to refactor! 

Through the refactoring process, I have made the following changes:

HTML

-Title was useless - changed a title that is more descriptive, although sarcastic

-Changed all of the <div> tags to be more speific

-Assigned "id" to the "search engine optimization" section under <article> so that this <nav> element knows what to reference. (The other 2 already had functioning "id"s)

-Added tabindex attribute to navigation elements to adhere to ADA compliance

-Added alt tags to the images to adhere to ADA compliance

CSS
-consolidated redundant key-value sets
-adjusted keys to hook into correct parts of HTML
